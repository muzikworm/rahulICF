		<p>Welcome to Indian Creative Forum,</p>
		<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to reiterate our firm belief in making the site truly accessible to the users, and keeping the users aware of the information we collect about them and how it is used.</p>

		<h5>OVERVIEW</h5>

		<p>As part of the normal operation of our services we collect and, in some cases, may disclose information about you. By accepting this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner listed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of Terms of Service.</p>

		<h5>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>

		<p>Our primary goal in collecting your personal information is to enable a smooth, efficient, and customized experience for you. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs and make your experience better. You agree that in order to assist you, our user, we may feature user profiles in our editorials and newsletters that we send out from time to time to our members. Your address and telephone number are confidential and will not be posted in your profile. Your profile is available for other members to view.</p>
		<p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our Websites using cookies, internal functions and other devices. We use this information for internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include, and is not limited to, the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not) which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.</p>

		<p>Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

		<p>If you choose to create your profile or answer or ask a question or use any service provided by our website, you must register via the Site to create an Account. When you (i) register with us through the Site to become a user (ii) choose to add information to your profile webpage or (iii) create a profile, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, company name (wherever applicable), phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and office postal addresses, as applicable. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.</p>

		<p>You may register to use the Services directly via the Site or by logging into your account with certain third party social media or social networking services (“SOCIAL NEtWORKING SITE”) (including, but not limited to, LinkedIn) via the Site, as described herein. If you decide to register through a SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE, we will extract the Personal Information you have provided to the SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE) from the account you have with the applicable SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE and use that information to create your Account. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE. You hereby consent to our access to and collection of such personal information about you.</p>

		<p>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”).</p>

		<p>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</p>

		<p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Indian Creative Forum users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>

		<p>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Indian Creative Forum newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>

Accordingly, Log Data is shared with Google, which has its own privacy policy addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information unless we use it in association with other Personal Information. We may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Log Data for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>

		<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy policies.

		<h5>SECURITY</h5>
		
		<p>We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the company. However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. You therefore agree that any security breaches beyond the control of our standard security procedures are at your sole risk and discretion.</p>
